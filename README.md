# Shortest path algorithms in a random maze (A* with and without heuristic, Bellman-Ford, Dijkstra)

**READ ME : You need to recompile the code if you don't find the path in the maze !**

I created a random maze and I used shortest path algorithms with the networkx library.

For display, I used the Matplotlib library to generate black cells that represent walls. The starting point is displayed in green while the ending point is displayed in red. The path is displayed in yellow.

You can modify the starting and ending parameters as well as the maze's wall appearance rate.
